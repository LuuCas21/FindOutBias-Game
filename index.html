            <h1>What does Bias means ?</h1>
            <p>
            "He's my bias!" "She's my ultimate bias!" But what does it mean? Don't be too frustrated,
            you weren't the only one who was curious about it.</p>

            <p>"Bias" in K-Pop is basically someone's most favorite member of an idol group. It is derived
            from the original way the word is used, to have a bias towards someone.</p>

            <p>So for example, if someone asks you "Who is your bias?", they're basically asking who your favorite
            K-Pop idol is of all time. The one you are infatuated about for some unknown reason other than having fallen
            in love with their charms. The one that your eyes automatically get fixed on when you see them on stage or on TV.</p>
